This module provides a custom formatter for taxonomy terms, allowing terms to be
linked to custom URL using taxonomy term tokens instead of default taxonomy term
page.

If i18n_taxonomy module is enabled, the term names will be also localized.

Most of the code is based on i18n_taxonomy module code.
